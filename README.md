# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

<h3> OSS Builds Status: </h3>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deniskovalchuk/ftp-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deniskovalchuk/ftp-client)

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standart network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. 

<h2>Communication and data transfer</h2>

FTP may run in active or passive mode, which determines how the data connection is established. In both cases, the client creates a TCP control connection from a random port to the FTP server command port 21.

* In active mode, the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port N. It sends the FTP command "PORT N" to inform the server on which port it is listening. The server then initiates a data channel to the client.

* In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections, passive mode may be used. In this mode, the client uses the control connection to send the FTP command "PASV" to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port numbuer from server, which the client then uses to open a data connection.
